00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,260
You're on junior CSS duty until further notice. Komish you can't do this to me

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:21,240

00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:47,100
clear to ship. Thanks. You're welcome. Next. It's an awfully big PR. For an intern. Well I just

7
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:54,260
bumped some dependencies. It's nothing major. Hey can I get a quick stamp on this? Yeah

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,300
reviewing take forever. We have code rabbit. Oh come on. I wasn't even merging the

13
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,340
prod. It was a hex code change. We have code rabbit. We don't need real

14
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,220
people reviewing such simple changes. Code rabbit can do it for us. Our engineer's
